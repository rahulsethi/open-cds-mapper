# data/

This folder holds **schemas** and **tiny sample CSVs** for local testing.  
No real data.

## Files

- `SCHEMAS.md` — CSV column definitions (what each field means).
- `ecc_extractors.sample.csv` — example ECC/BW extractors with a small `fields_json` list.
- `s4_cds.sample.csv` — example S/4 CDS views with `fields_json` and basic annotations.

> JSON-in-CSV: the `fields_json` and `primary_keys_json` columns are JSON strings.
